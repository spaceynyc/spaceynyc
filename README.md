hey, i'm steven 👋

i build things with LLMs and try to make AI actually useful.

## what i'm working on

🔬 **Socionics Research Lab** — multi-agent AI system for personality typing. three specialist agents analyze from different angles, then an adversarial validator checks their work. built the prototype in python/streamlit, rebuilt it properly in next.js.

## what i'm into

- multi-agent architectures and agentic workflows
- - making complex systems understandable
  - - personality typology (socionics specifically - 7+ years deep)
    - - figuring out what AI is actually good for beyond demos
     
      - ## stack
     
      - python javascript react next.js langchain streamlit
     
      - ---

      currently looking for roles where i can build things and solve problems — solutions engineering, dev rel, or similar. if you're working on something interesting, let's talk.
